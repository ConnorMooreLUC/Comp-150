It was a stormy afternoon, and Connor was running late,
suddenly he realized he had left behind his {thing}.
Since he had only {tardyness} left before his class,
he couldn't run back. Drenched with rain, cursing his negligence,
he sprinted into {building}.  "Oops, sorry!",  Connor muttered
after bumping into a friend Alex, "Here take my {thing}" Alex said.
"Thanks Alex!", I briskly responded.  I burst through Professor
{teacher}'s room.  Luckily Professor {teacher} didn't mind Connor
was soaking wet, because {building} was in disrepair.

The End
